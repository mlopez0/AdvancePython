Question #4

Logarithms base 2 are bast used in maths and other fields; in computer science, the binary logarithms are used (log2) to compute the complexity.
Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones and join 
the solutions of the subproblems. 
The logarithm difference between two small numbers is large, although the logarithm difference between two large numbers is small.
