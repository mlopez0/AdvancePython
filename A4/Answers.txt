Question #4

Logarithms base 2 are bast used in maths and others fiels, in computer science the binary logarithms is used 
to compute the complexity.

Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones, and join 
the solutions of the subproblems. The logarithm difference between two small numbers is large
although the logarithm difference between two large numbers is small.
