Question #4

In computer science, binary logarithms are used (log2) to compute complexity.
Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones and join the solutions of the subproblems. (Divide and conquer).

Something else can be used... We can also make an estimation based on Zipf's law using the equation n = t(E+ln(t)) where E=0.5772, which is the Euler constant.
Although those two-length estimations have equations of a different form (Halstead and Zipfs), they produce the same length estimation.

Since logarithm is another way of writing exponential equations that allows split the exponent a part of the equation. As complexity problems increase, the complexity may also rise exponentially.
